      <description>Tenseur is a header only c++ numerical library. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to provide high-performance linear algebra and multilinear algebra operations by laveraging the capabilities of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) backends. This library, currently in development, aims to offer a robust framework for numerical computations focusing on both performance and easy of use. In this blog post, we will first describe some design decisions. Then we will show some of its features and advantages over other libraries.</description>

      <description>The optimal transport problem is a fascinating area in applied mathematics and optimization. One way to tackle this problem is through minimum cost bipartite matching. In this blog, we will show how this problem can be represented by a bipartite graph where the edges connecting the nodes are weighted by the transportation cost and then we will show step by step how to use minimum cost bipartite matching to solve the problem.</description>
